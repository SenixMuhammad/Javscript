# Javascript
## Getting started with javascript 
JavaScript is a popular programming 
language that has a wide range of 
applications.
JavaScript was previously used mainly for 
making webpages interactive such as form 
validation, animation, etc. Nowadays, 
JavaScript is also used in many other areas 
such as server-side development, mobile 
app development and so on.

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT
### 1995
Based on that, JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in September 1995. He took inspiration from three languages—Java, Self, and Scheme—to create JavaScript. JavaScript derives its syntax from Java, its first-class functions from Scheme, and its prototype-based inheritance from Self.

The name JavaScript is a result of marketing strategies. At the beginning, Brendan Eich called it Mocha (a code name). Inside Netscape, they used the name LiveScript. Yet, when they had to choose a public name, “JavaScript” was the winner.

Why? This language was made to interest Java programmers, and “script” was trendy for describing lightweight programs back then. These lightweight “scripts” were the first to be put into pages on this new thing called the web!

On September 18, 1995, Netscape Communications Corporation released the Netscape Navigator 2.0 web browser.
### ECMA Standardization
To address this issue and promote a consistent and standardized approach, Netscape decided to submit JavaScript to ECMA for standardization in November 1996. By creating a standardized specification for JavaScript, Netscape aimed to encourage other browser vendors, including Microsoft, to adopt the standardized version. This would reduce the fragmentation caused by different implementations of the same language and ensure a more consistent experience for web developers and users across different browsers.

ECMA is an international standards organization. Its purpose is to create and maintain standards for information and communication technology. It ensures that technologies are consistent, interoperable, and well-documented, benefiting industries and users by promoting compatibility and innovation.

Every time there’s something new to set standards for, ECMA gives out a standard guide (or specification) and puts together a group of experts called a committee.

In case of JavaScript, the standard is ECMA-262 and The committee that works on ECMA-262 called Technical Committee 39 (TC39)

ECMA Decided to use the term ECMAScript to talk about the official language because Oracle (which acquired Sun Microsystems) owns the trademark for the term JavaScript.
## JAVASCRIPT RELEASES

The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting 
language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape initially named Mocha, then 
LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

parts!
## Run JavaScript
Because of its wide range of 
applications, you can run 
JavaScript in several ways:
#### • Using console tab of web browsers
#### • Using Node.js
#### • By creating web pages
## 1. Using Console Tab of Web Browsers
1. Open your browser and right click in any empty area and select inspect or press F12.
2. Open the developer tools and go to Console tab. Write the Javascript code and press Enter

## 2. Using Node.js
Node is a back-end environment for executing JavaScript 
code. To run JS using Node.js, follow these steps:
1. Install the latest version of Node.js.
2. Open Visual studio code and create js file
3. Run node hello.js
4. See the result

## 3. By creating web pages 
JavaScript was initially created to make web pages 
interactive, that's why JavaScript and HTML go hand in 
hand. To run JS from a webpage, follow these steps:
1. Create new folder 
2. Create index.html, script.js files
3. Write shown line of codes

## JavaScript Variables and Constants
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them.
However, there are some differences between them.
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended
to use const .
## Var

## let

## const
![alt text](image-16.png)
## OBJECTS AND PRIMITIVES
### Have 2 type
### 1.Object
### 2.Primitive
## OBJECTS AND PRIMITIVES
### Primitive Types
#### 1.Number
#### 2.String
#### 3.Boolean
#### 4.Undefind
#### 5.null
#### 6.Symbol
#### 7.bigInt 
### Object types
#### 1.Object
#### 2.Array
#### 3.Function
#### 4.Many others
## Rules for Naming JavaScript Variables
1. Variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the dollar sign $.
2. Variable names cannot start with numbers. For example:
let 1simpleText = 'Javascript is really simple';
console.log(1simpleText);

## Operators IN JavaScript
### Arithmetic 
+,-,*,/
### Comparison
==,===,!=,!==,<=,>=
### Logical
||,&&,!
### Type Conversions
Number("3.14")
### Assignment
=,-=,+=,*=,...
## JavaScript Type Conversions
### There are two types of type conversion in JavaScript
####  1. Implicite type Conversion
####  2. Explixite type Conversion

## Three important topics
### CONDITIONS
### LOOPS
### FUNCTIONS
## CONDITION If/else statement
### First condition true
![alt text](image-19.png)
### Second condition true
![alt text](image-20.png)
### All condition false
![alt text](image-21.png)
## CONDITION Ternary operator
![alt text](image-22.png)
## CONDITION Switch statment
The switch statement evaluates
an expression, matching the
expression's value against a series
of case clauses, and executes
statements after the first case
clause with a matching value, 
until a break statement is
encountered. The default clause
of a switch statement will be
jumped to if no case matches the
expression's value.
![alt text](image-23.png)
## LOOP for
The for statement creates a loop that
consists of three optional expressions, 
enclosed in parentheses and separated by
semicolons, followed by a statement
(usually a block statement) to be
executed in the loop.
The following for statement starts by 
declaring the variable i and initializing it 
to 0. It checks that i is less than nine, 
performs the two succeeding statements, 
and increments i by 1 after each pass 
through the loop.
![alt text](image-24.png)
## LOOP while
The while statement creates a loop that
executes a specified statement as long as
the test condition evaluates to true. The 
condition is evaluated before executing the
statement.
The following while loop iterates as long as
n is less than three.
Note: Use the break statement to stop a 
loop before condition evaluates to true.
![alt text](image-25.png)
## LOOP Do/while
The do...while statement creates a loop
that executes a specified statement until
the test condition evaluates to false. The 
condition is evaluated after executing
the statement, resulting in the specified
statement executing at least once.
In the following example, the do...while 
loop iterates at least once and reiterates 
until i is no longer less than 5.

## FUNCTIONS
### There are 3 ways of writing a function in JavaScript
#### 1.Function Declaration
#### 2.Function Expression
#### 3.Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
## FUNCTION Declaration
The function declaration defines a 
function with the specified
parameters. A function is declared 
using the function keyword.
The basic rules of naming a function 
are similar to naming a variable. It is 
better to write a descriptive name for 
your function. For example, if a 
function is used to add two numbers, 
you could name the function add or 
addNumbers.
![alt text](image-27.png)
## FUNCTION expression
A function expression is very
similar to and has almost the
same syntax as a function
declaration.
The main difference between a 
function expression and a 
function declaration is
the function name, which can be
omitted in function expressions
to create anonymous and 
arrow functions.
![alt text](image-28.png)
## FUNCTION iife
An IIFE (Immediately Invoked 
Function Expression) is a function 
that runs the moment it is invoked 
or called in the JavaScript event 
loop.
Having a function that behaves 
that way can be useful in certain 
situations. IIFEs prevent pollution 
of the global JS scope.
